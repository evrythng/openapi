  summary: 'Update a Thng''s location'
  description: 'Update a Thng''s location. The payload must always be an array of `LocationDocument` objects, which allows you to send several locations (with different timestamps each) in a single request. This is useful when a device wants to update a path cached over a certain period of time at once. An example would be a taxi that updates the whole set of locations it has been through once per hour instead of sending each GPS sensor reading individually.'
